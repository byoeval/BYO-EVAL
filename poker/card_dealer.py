    """
    Resolves card counts from inputs, shuffles a deck (if no repetition), 
    and deals cards (sequentially or with replacement). Enforces maximum counts.

    Args:
        distribution_inputs: A dictionary containing distribution parameters like
                             'river_cards', 'player_cards', 'overall_cards',
                             'max_player_cards', 'max_river_cards', etc.
                             Corresponds to CardDistributionInput structure.
        num_players: The number of player hands to deal for.
        deck: The list of card names to use as the source deck.
        random_seed: Optional random seed for shuffling or random choice.
        allow_repetition: If True, deal by randomly choosing from the deck with
                          replacement. If False, shuffle the deck once and deal
                          sequentially without replacement.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing:
        {
            'river': List[str],     # List of card names for the river
            'players': List[List[str]] # List of lists, where each inner list contains
                                     # card names for a player.
        }
        Returns empty lists if dealing fails (e.g., not enough cards).
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the total number of cards required exceeds the deck size
        when repetition is not allowed. Or if inputs are invalid.
